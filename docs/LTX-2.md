## Optimizing Quality

LTX-2 is an advanced model capable of generating amazing videos. Tweaking the settings has a big impact on quality. Here are the key recommendations:

- **Resolution**: The highest quality is typically achieved at **1080p**.
- **Frame Rate**:
  - Motion videos benefit from higher FPS, up to **50 FPS** (may require lowering resolution).
  - Static videos (e.g., close‑ups) work well at **15 FPS**.
- **Text‑to‑Image vs Image‑to‑Image**: Providing a high‑quality input image usually improves the output quality.
- **Steps**: In testing, **20 steps** is a good balance between performance and quality. Increasing to **30 steps and beyond should increase quality**.
- **General tip**: Adjust resolution, length, and FPS to stay within your GPU’s VRAM limits while iterating.
